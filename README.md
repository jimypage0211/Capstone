# CAPSTONE - BookYourFood

This is my Final Project for the course CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It is built with Django, Hmtl, Css, Javascript, Python & Bootsrap

## Description

Build an app that lets you book where you want to eat today! This app will let you log in and choose from a series of previously added restaurants and let you make a booking for the place you want to reserve.
When the reservation is done it will send the user an email with the reservation info for the booking. The user will also have access to the current reservation it holds and the history of reservations made.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

I believe my project is distant enough from the projects done in this course since it handles email interaction with the users and manages dates, times, and timezone awareness logic which wasn't used in the previous projects for the course.

## Structure
### Pages
**AllRestaurants Page:** This is where the user goes when its logged in. This page will show you the list of all possible restaurants to book
